# Simple Email Format for Primary Inbox Placement

This document provides key insights based on analyzing the actual email format being used.

## Current Email Format

Looking at the actual email content that is being sent through the system:

```html
<p>Enter the code into the verification screen and your email will be validated <strong>8923</strong></p>
```

This is an extremely simple format with just a paragraph and bold text for the verification code.

## Key Success Factors

Based on the information we have, these are the critical factors for inbox placement:

### 1. Ultra-Simple HTML Structure

The successful approach uses only basic HTML - a single paragraph with bold text for the code:

```html
<p>Enter the code into the verification screen and your email will be validated <strong>8923</strong></p>
```

### 2. Minimal Headers

Only essential headers are used:
```
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
```

### 3. Direct Subject Line

The subject line is simple and descriptive:
```
Add You App Name Email Verification
```

### 4. Properly Configured DKIM/SPF

For this to work properly, the domain must have proper DKIM and SPF records set up in DNS.

### 5. No Unnecessary Elements

The email contains:
- No images
- No links
- No CSS styling
- No footer
- No fancy formatting
- No tracking pixels

## Implementation Guide

1. **Keep HTML Minimal**: Just a single paragraph with bold code
2. **Use Basic Headers**: Only include the essential headers
3. **Simple Subject Line**: Use clear, direct subject that matches your app
4. **Verify DKIM/SPF**: Ensure proper DNS configuration
5. **4-Digit Code**: Use a 4-digit numerical code

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-formatting**: Avoid complex HTML structures
2. **Long Subject Lines**: Keep subjects concise
3. **Excess HTML**: Avoid divs, tables, and CSS if not needed
4. **Excess Headers**: Don't add unnecessary headers
5. **Using Links**: Avoid URLs in verification emails

## Testing

When testing email delivery:

1. Send the exact format shown above
2. Check where the email lands (Primary, Promotions, Spam)
3. If it goes to spam, try sending with even simpler text

## Troubleshooting

If emails still land in spam:

1. Check DNS records (SPF, DKIM)
2. Try removing the `<strong>` tags and using plain text
3. Verify the sender domain has a good reputation
4. Make sure the email is properly encoded

## Why Simple Works

Very simple emails tend to bypass spam filters because:

1. They lack complex patterns that trigger spam detection
2. They look like personal communications
3. They don't contain marketing patterns
4. They match what users expect from verification emails

Remember that different email providers have different rules, so what works for Gmail might not work for other providers. Testing is essential.

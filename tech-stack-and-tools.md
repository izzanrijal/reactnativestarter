#### Core Technologies

-   **Language:** TypeScript (for type safety, improved code quality, and easier maintenance)
-   **Framework:** React Native (for building cross-platform mobile apps with a single codebase)
-   **Build Tool:** Expo (for simplified development, build process, and access to device APIs)
-   **State Management:**  React Context + useReducer (built-in, sufficient for this project's complexity. Avoids external dependencies).  Consider Zustand or Redux Toolkit *only* if the app's state becomes significantly complex.
-   **Navigation:** React Navigation (standard library for navigation in React Native, already included in your project)
-   **Styling:** StyleSheet (built into React Native, optimized for performance.  This aligns with the `react-native.mdc` rule).
-   **Forms:** react-hook-form (already a dependency, excellent for controlled forms and validation)
-   **HTTP Client** Resend (already a dependency)
- **Testing**
    - Consider a unit testing framework like Jest

#### Backend & Database

-   **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase (already integrated, provides authentication, real-time database, and storage)
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL (provided by Supabase, robust and scalable)
-   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (handles user authentication, integrates well with React Native via `supabase-js`)
-   **Email Service:** Resend (already in use for verification emails, provides good deliverability features)

#### Utilities and Libraries

- **Async Storage:** `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (used by Supabase for session persistence, already a dependency)
- **Environment Variables:** `dotenv` (for managing configuration, already included via `app.config.js`)
- **Icons:** `@fortawesome/react-native-fontawesome`, `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core` (already included, consider using react-native-vector-icons.  It is versatile and widely supported.)

####  Development Tools

-   **Code Editor:** VS Code (with recommended extensions: Prettier, ESLint, Deno (for Supabase Functions))
-   **Version Control:** Git (with GitHub)
-   **Package Manager:** Yarn (your project is already using it)
- **Debugging** React Native Debugger

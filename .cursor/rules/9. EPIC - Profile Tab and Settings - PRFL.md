The recording will be transcribed live, stored, and its transcript sent to the server as additional feedback. This prompt appears only once (although it can be skipped) and is aimed at users who have already experienced a consultation._
    

---

- **[PRFL-AC23]**  
    **Given** the NPS prompt is displayed,

- **[PRFL-AC25]**  
    **Given** the recording session is completed,  
    **when** the voice feedback stops,  
    **then** the audio is transcribed live, and the transcript and voice note file are sent to the server as part of the feedback.

    **when** the user attempts to record her feedback,  
    **then** the system displays an error message and allows her to retry the recording session.
    
- **[PRFL-EDGE13]**  
    **Given** the user dismisses or skips the feedback prompt,  
    **when** she continues to use the app,

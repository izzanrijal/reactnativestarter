## **Group 1: Doctor Discovery & Selection (Ahli Tab)**

### **Original User Stories**

- **Story 1:**  
    _As a mom, when I access the Ahli tab, I want to view a list of pediatricians categorized by their categories (e.g., nutrition, skin issues, respiratory) so that I can quickly choose the doctor best suited to my child's current health concern._
    
- **Story 2:**  
    _As a first-time mom accessing the Ahli tab, I want detailed information on each doctor's background, education, and certifications so that I trust their recommendations and feel confident in my choices._
    
- **Story 3:**  
    _As a busy mom viewing the Ahli tab, I want to see each doctor's typical response times clearly indicated (e.g., within 1 hours, same-day) so that I can choose a doctor matching my urgency level._
    
- **Story 4:**  
    _As a mom with an urgent concern using the Ahli tab, I want to filter and quickly select pediatricians currently marked as "available" so that my child's issue is addressed promptly._
    
- **Story 5:**  
    _As a budget-conscious mom on the Ahli tab, I want clear visibility into consultation fees or subscription plans associated with each pediatrician so that I avoid unexpected costs and make financially-informed choices._
    
- **Story 6:**  
    _As a mom using the Ahli tab, I want to preview samples or snippets of previous doctor voice responses (anonymized) so that I understand their communication style and feel comfortable with their approach._
    
- **Story 8:**  
    _As a mom seeking local medical advice via the Ahli tab, I want to sort or filter pediatricians by the distance or proximity of their physical practice locations so that I can conveniently select doctors nearby if offline follow-up becomes necessary._
	
- **Story 9**
	As a mom using the Ahli tab, I want to sort pediatricians based on both proximity and response time so that I can quickly choose the fastest-responding and nearest available doctor. Even if a doctor is located close and responds quickly, if they are unavailable, they should always be listed after the available ones.
    
### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **Given** a mom accesses the Ahli tab (doctor listing page), **when** the page loads, **then** it should display pediatricians categorized by categories (e.g., nutrition, skin issues, respiratory).
    
- **Given** the user is a first-time mom, **when** she clicks on a doctor's profile, **then** detailed information (background, education, certifications) must be displayed.
    
- **Given** a busy mom is reviewing the list, **when** each doctor's profile is shown, **then** the typical response time (e.g., within 3 hours, same-day) is clearly indicated.
    
- **Given** an urgent concern filter is applied, **when** the mom selects "available" doctors, **then** only pediatricians currently marked as "available" should be displayed.
    
- **Given** a budget-conscious mom is checking the doctor list, **when** the profiles are presented, **then** consultation fees must be clearly visible alongside each pediatrician.
    
- **Given** the option to preview voice response snippets, **when** the user interacts with the preview option, **then** anonymized voice response samples should be available.
    
- **Given** that a mom accesses the doctor list page for the first time, **when** the page loads, **then** a modal should appear asking if she would like to search for pediatricians based on the nearest practice locations.
    
- **Given** the modal is presented, **when** the mom accepts, **then** the system should automatically sort and display the doctor list by proximity to her current or registered location.
    
- **Given** that the mom later decides to sort the list by location manually, **when** she selects the location sort option, **then** the system should request proximity location permission again and update the list accordingly.
    
- **Given** a new user selects a doctor from the list, **when** the doctor profile is accessed, **then** all pertinent details (specialty, reviews, location, cost, experience) must load seamlessly.
    
- **Given** that a mom accesses the doctor listing page with proximity location permission granted, **when** the page loads, **then** the doctor list must be automatically sorted so that available pediatricians appear first (sorted by proximity), followed by unavailable pediatricians (also sorted by proximity).
    
- **Given** that a pediatrician is not marked as available, **when** the mom views the doctor profile in the listing, **then** that profile must appear greyed out and the option to purchase a consultation session must be disabled.
    
- **Given** that proximity location permission is provided, **when** the mom views the doctor listing page, **then** available doctors closest to her location must be prioritized, ensuring quick access for urgent needs without requiring an explicit filter.
    
- **Given** that the proximity prompt is denied on first access, **when** the doctor listing page is displayed, **then** the list should default to sorting by availability only (without applying location sorting) until the user manually opts to sort by location again, at which point the system will request proximity permission.

- **Given** the modal is presented, **when** the mom denies the prompt, **then** the system should not display the modal again on subsequent visits, and the list remains unsorted by location by default.

- **Given** that a mom accesses the doctor listing page with proximity location permission granted, **when** the page loads, **then** the system must automatically sort the list so that available pediatricians are displayed first, sorted by their nearest proximity and fastest response times.

- **Given** that the doctor listing page defaults to sorting by availability, **when** the mom reviews the list, **then** the available doctors are always prioritized over unavailable ones, and within each group, the sorting is determined by proximity and response time.
    
- **Given** that the mom manually applies a sort option for response time, **when** the sort is executed, **then** the system must still ensure that available doctors are listed first, with unavailable doctors following in order.

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

- **Given** that proximity location permission is not yet provided, **when** the mom opts to manually sort by location and response time, **then** the system should request the necessary permission and, upon acceptance, update the list accordingly.

- **Given** that a pediatrician's availability status is incorrectly flagged (e.g., an available doctor is marked unavailable or vice versa), **when** the sorting is applied, **then** the system should fallback to a default ordering based solely on availability and log an error for further review.
    
- **Given** that location or response time data for a doctor is missing or invalid, **when** the sorting algorithm runs, **then** the system should treat the missing data as lowest priority—placing that doctor below available ones with valid data—and notify the user (e.g., via a subtle warning) that some data could not be verified.
    
- **Given** that a manual sorting request is made while the system is unable to fetch updated location or response time data due to a network error, **when** the sorting is executed, **then** the system should display a fallback list sorted solely by availability, and alert the user to the temporary data issue.

- **Given** some doctor profiles have incomplete details (e.g., missing background or certification info), **when** a profile is viewed, **then** the system should display a placeholder message (e.g., "Information not available") without disrupting the layout.

## **Group 2: Consultation Initiation & Continuation**

### **Original User Stories**

- **Story 10:**  
    _As a returning mom who trusts certain pediatricians, I want a dedicated "quick consult" button beside a pediatrician's name on the list so that I immediately start or purchase a consultation session without needing to view their profile again._
    
- **Story 11:**  
    _As a mom returning with ongoing concerns, I want a clear option to easily resume or continue previous conversations or follow-up questions with the same pediatrician so that I don't have to repeat details or context previously discussed._  
    _(Displayed on the doctor's profile with conversation history.)_
    
- **Story 12:**  
    _As a mom, I want previous conversations clearly marked with "Continue Consultation" buttons directly on interaction history so that I smoothly and quickly reconnect with pediatricians on unresolved or ongoing health issues._
    
- **Story 13:**  
    _As a mom, I want clear visibility of consultation fees upfront, displayed prominently before initiating payment so that I avoid surprise charges._
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **Given** a returning mom views the doctor list, **when** she identifies a trusted pediatrician, **then** a "quick consult" button must be visible beside the doctor's name.
    
- **Given** a mom with ongoing concerns is on a doctor's profile, **when** she reviews her conversation history, **then** an option to resume previous consultations should be clearly accessible.
    
- **Given** the conversation history is displayed, **when** the "Continue Consultation" button is clicked, **then** the session must resume with all previous context intact. (Purchase a consultation first)
    
- **Given** the consultation fee is a key factor, **when** the consultation is initiated, **then** the fee must be displayed clearly and prominently prior to payment.
    
- **Given** that fee details are critical for decision making, **when** a user proceeds with a consultation, **then** the fee information must be consistent with that shown in the doctor's profile.
    

---

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

- **Given** the "quick consult" button fails to initiate a session due to a network error, **when** the user clicks the button, **then** an error message should appear prompting her to retry.
    
- **Given** the conversation history does not load (e.g., server timeout), **when** the mom attempts to resume a consultation, **then** the system should display a fallback error message advising her to refresh or try again later.
    
- **Given** there is a discrepancy in consultation fees between the listing and the payment page, **when** the user proceeds to pay, **then** the system should halt the transaction and notify the user of the inconsistency.

## **Group 3: Consultation Type Selection**

> **As a mom**, I want a clear step before making payment to select the type of consultation I prefer—either **Rp 50,000 for unlimited questions within a 30-minute session**, or **Rp 20,000 for a single main topic with up to 2 follow-up questions (no topic changes allowed)**, so that I can choose the consultation option that best fits my current needs and budget, ensuring transparency and satisfaction.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Given** the mom is ready to initiate a paid consultation,  
    **when** she navigates to the consultation selection screen,  
    **then** two distinct consultation options must be displayed side-by-side:
    
    - **Rp 50,000** for an unlimited, 30-minute session
        
    - **Rp 20,000** for a single-topic session with up to two follow-up questions
        
2. **Given** the mom is viewing the consultation options,  
    **when** she selects the **Rp 50,000** unlimited session,  
    **then** that choice must be visually highlighted, and a brief description (e.g., "Unlimited questions for 30 minutes") should appear.
    
3. **Given** the mom is viewing the consultation options,  
    **when** she selects the **Rp 20,000** single-topic session,  
    **then** that choice must be visually highlighted, and a clear notice should appear indicating "Up to 2 follow-up questions, no topic changes allowed."
    
4. **Given** the mom has chosen her preferred consultation type,  
    **when** she proceeds to the payment step,  
    **then** the correct fee (either Rp 50,000 or Rp 20,000) should be displayed prominently, along with a summary of the session rules (duration, number of follow-up questions, etc.).
    
5. **Given** the mom is on the payment page,  
    **when** the final price is confirmed,  
    **then** the system must ensure that the selected consultation type and total fee align with the user's choice before allowing payment completion.
    

---

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

1. **Given** a mom attempts to proceed to payment without selecting any consultation type,  
    **when** she clicks "Continue" or "Pay,"  
    **then** the system must block the action and display an error message (e.g., "Please select a consultation type before proceeding").
    
2. **Given** there is an error or time-out retrieving the consultation package details (e.g., server issue),  
    **when** the mom lands on the consultation selection screen,  
    **then** the system should display an error message and prevent progression until the packages are successfully loaded or the user retries.
    
3. **Given** a mom selects one consultation type,  
    **when** she tries to change the type after completing the payment,  
    **then** the system must prevent changes and display a warning (e.g., "You have already paid. Changing the consultation type is not possible.").
    
4. **Given** the system incorrectly assigns the wrong price to a consultation type,  
    **when** the mom proceeds to the payment screen,  
    **then** the system should halt the transaction and display an error stating that there is an inconsistency in the consultation fee (e.g., "Price mismatch—please refresh or contact support").

## **Group 4: Discount Code Application**

### **User Stories**

1. **As a user**, I want to **enter a discount code** when choosing my consultation type (single-question or 30-minute unlimited) **so that** I can see my potential savings before I finalize my choice and proceed.
    
2. **As a user**, I want to **see the discounted total** (if applicable) displayed **immediately after selecting the consultation type and applying the code** so that I know exactly what I will be charged.
    
3. **As a user**, I want the **option to remove or replace** the discount code before finalizing my consultation type and moving on **so that** I can compare different codes or correct errors if I entered the wrong one.
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)**

1. **Discount Code Input Field at Consultation Selection**
    
    - **Given** a user is on the screen where they select their consultation type (e.g., single-question session or 30-minute unlimited session),
        
    - **When** the page loads,
        
    - **Then** an **optional field** labeled "Discount Code" should be visible on this selection screen (or a popup/field linked to it), enabling the user to enter a promo code **before** finalizing their consultation choice.
        
2. **Validation of Discount Code**
    
    - **Given** a user has entered a discount code in the field,
        
    - **When** the user taps "Apply" (or equivalent action),
        
    - **Then** the system **validates** the code (checking the database for validity, expiration, usage limits, etc.) and provides **immediate feedback** (e.g., "Valid code—discount applied" or "Invalid/expired code").
        
3. **Recalculating the Total Fee**
    
    - **Given** the user successfully applies a discount code,
        
    - **When** the user has chosen a consultation type,
        
    - **Then** the system **recalculates** the price based on the type of discount (percentage off or fixed nominal discount) and **updates the displayed total** accordingly.
        
4. **Immediate Visibility of Discounted Price**
    
    - **Given** a discount code is valid and has been applied,
        
    - **When** the user views the consultation options again (e.g., toggling between single-question or 30-minute session),
        
    - **Then** the displayed fee for each consultation option **reflects** the discounted price in real time (or shows both original and discounted amounts for clarity).
        
5. **Removing or Replacing a Discount Code**
    
    - **Given** a user has already applied a discount code,
        
    - **When** the user decides to remove or change it **before** proceeding (e.g., before finalizing consultation type or moving to payment),
        
    - **Then** the system must allow them to **remove** the code (resetting the prices to original) or **enter a new one**, triggering a new validation process.
        
6. **Confirmation of Discount Before Payment**
    
    - **Given** the user has applied a discount code while selecting the consultation type,
        
    - **When** the user taps "Continue" or "Proceed to Payment,"
        
    - **Then** the system must **carry over** the discounted fee into the final payment step, ensuring consistency in the displayed price and any receipts/invoices.
        

---

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

1. **Invalid or Expired Code**
    
    - **Given** a user enters a discount code that is invalid or expired,
        
    - **When** the user taps "Apply,"
        
    - **Then** the system displays an **error message** ("Code is invalid or expired") and **does not** adjust any fee.
        
2. **Failed Code Validation (Server or Network Error)**
    
    - **Given** the system cannot connect to the database to validate the code (due to a network or server error),
        
    - **When** the user taps "Apply,"
        
    - **Then** the system displays a **fallback error** (e.g., "Unable to validate your code at this time. Please retry or contact support.") and **blocks** discount application until resolved.
        
3. **Single-Use or Usage Limit Reached**
    
    - **Given** a code can only be used once (or has a maximum redemption count),
        
    - **When** the user tries to use it again or after the limit is reached,
        
    - **Then** the system must reject the code and show a **clear message** ("This code has already been used or reached its usage limit.").
        
4. **Zero or Negative Final Price**
    
    - **Given** a code's value might exceed the consultation fee,
        
    - **When** the total discount surpasses the cost of the selected consultation type,
        
    - **Then** the system **caps** the discount at 100% (fee cannot go below zero) and displays a final price of Rp 0 (if fully discounted).
        
5. **Switching Consultation Type After Applying a Discount**
    
    - **Given** a user has applied a discount code to one consultation type,
        
    - **When** the user toggles to another consultation type (e.g., from Rp 20,000 single-question to Rp 50,000 unlimited),
        
    - **Then** the system must either **re-validate** the discount code with the new fee or **automatically re-apply** it if still valid, updating the displayed price accordingly.
        
6. **Payment Failure After Applying Discount**
    
    - **Given** the user's discounted selection is carried over to payment,
        
    - **When** the payment fails (e.g., card error, network issue),
        
    - **Then** the system must **not** mark the code as used. The user should be able to retry payment or re-enter the code if needed.

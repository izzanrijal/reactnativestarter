## Group 1: Consultation History Search & Session Re-Initiation (Riwayat Tab)

### Original User Stories

1. **Story 1:**  
    _As a mom, when I access the Riwayat tab, I want a simple search bar at the top of my consultation history, clearly prompting me to input keywords, dates, or doctor names, so that finding relevant historical consultations is intuitive and effortless._
    
2. **Story 2:**  
    _As a mom using the Riwayat tab, I want search results clearly highlighting matched keywords or phrases within consultation summaries, topics, or doctor names, so that I quickly identify the exact consultation I need._
    
3. **Story 3:**  
    _As a mom, when viewing a past completed consultation chat in the Riwayat tab, I want a clear Call-to-Action button labeled "Mulai Lagi Sesi Konsultasi" ("Restart Consultation Session"), which upon clicking checks the original doctor's availability and, if available, initiates a *new* consultation purchase flow pre-selecting that doctor, so that I can seamlessly follow up on health concerns._

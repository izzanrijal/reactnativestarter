## **Group 1: Internationalization & Language Switching**

- **[INT-US1] Story I:**  
    _As a user, I want to change the application's user interface language (e.g., Indonesian â†” English) from my profile/settings navbar so that all text displayed can be updated dynamically. In the future, when additional languages (such as French) are added, the system should support this without requiring changes to the codebase._

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **[INT-AC1]**  
    **Given** the user is logged in, **when** they navigate to the profile/settings navbar and select a language option (e.g., Indonesian or English), **then** the entire UI immediately updates to display text in the selected language using resource files.
    
- **[INT-AC2]**  
    **Given** all UI text is stored in external language resource files, **when** the user changes the language setting, **then** the system loads the corresponding resource file and applies the translations across all pages without any hard-coded text changes.
    
- **[INT-AC3]**  
    **Given** that a new language (e.g., French) is added as a resource file, **when** the user selects this language from the settings, **then** the UI dynamically updates with the new language without any additional code modifications.
    
- **[INT-AC4]**  
    **Given** the user selects a language, **when** the user navigates between different pages or refreshes the app, **then** the selected language persists (by storing the setting in the user profile or local storage).
    
- **[INT-AC5]**  
    **Given** a language change is initiated during an active session, **when** the system is loading the new language resource file, **then** a fallback mechanism displays default text (from a default language) if any delays or errors occur.

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

- **[INT-EDGE1]**  
    **Given** a translation key is missing in the selected language resource file, **when** the UI attempts to render that text, **then** the system falls back to the default language text rather than showing a blank or error message.
    
- **[INT-EDGE2]**  
    **Given** the user selects a language for which the resource file is missing or not supported, **when** the language switch is attempted, **then** the system reverts to the default language (e.g., English) and displays a notification indicating that the selected language is unavailable.
    
- **[INT-EDGE3]**  
    **Given** a network error occurs while fetching the new language resource file, **when** the user changes the language, **then** the system displays a loading indicator and, if the error persists, continues using the previously loaded language while logging the error.
    
- **[INT-EDGE4]**  
    **Given** a user logs out and later logs back in, **when** the application loads, **then** the user's last selected language is retained from their profile settings, ensuring a consistent user experience.

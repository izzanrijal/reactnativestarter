For EVERY file you modify or create, you MUST provide the COMPLETE file contents in the format above.

Each file should be wrapped in a code block with its file path above it and a "Here's what I did and why":

Here's what I did and why: [text here...]
Filepath: src/components/Example.tsx
```
/**
 * @description 
 * This component handles [specific functionality].
 * It is responsible for [specific responsibilities].
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Feature 1: Description
 * - Feature 2: Description
 * 
 * @dependencies
 * - DependencyA: Used for X
 * - DependencyB: Used for Y
 * 
 * @notes
 * - Important implementation detail 1
 * - Important implementation detail 2

BEGIN WRITING FILE CODE
// Complete implementation with extensive inline comments & documentation...
```

Documentation requirements:
- File-level documentation explaining the purpose and scope
- Component/function-level documentation detailing inputs, outputs, and behavior
- Inline comments explaining complex logic or business rules
- Type documentation for all interfaces and types
- Notes about edge cases and error handling
- Any assumptions or limitations

Guidelines:
- Implement exactly one step at a time
- Ensure all code follows the project rules and technical specification
- Include ALL necessary imports and dependencies
- Write clean, well-documented code with appropriate error handling
- Always provide COMPLETE file contents - never use ellipsis (...) or placeholder comments
- Never skip any sections of any file - provide the entire file every time
- Handle edge cases and add input validation where appropriate
- Follow TypeScript best practices and ensure type safety
- Include necessary tests as specified in the testing strategy

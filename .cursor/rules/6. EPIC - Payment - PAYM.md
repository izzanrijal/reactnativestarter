## **Group A: Payment Initiation & Confirmation**

### **Original User Stories in This Group**

1. **[PAYM-US1] (Story 1)**  
    _As a mom, I want to immediately initiate payment via Flip.id when clicking "Chat with Doctor" or "Continue Session" so that the consultation session starts seamlessly and without delay._
    
2. **[PAYM-US2] (Story 2)**  
    _As a mom, I want confirmation that my payment was successfully processed before consultation begins so that I'm assured my session is active and valid._
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **[PAYM-AC1]**
    **Given** the mom clicks "Chat with Doctor" or "Continue Session,"  
    **when** the system directs her to the payment process via Flip.id,  
    **then** she must see a seamless transition to the payment gateway without any extra steps or delays.
    
2. **[PAYM-AC2]**
    **Given** the payment gateway is displayed,  
    **when** the mom completes the payment successfully,  
    **then** the system should display an on-screen confirmation (e.g., "Payment Successful!") and automatically transition to the consultation session.
    
3. **[PAYM-AC3]**
    **Given** a payment is confirmed,  
    **when** the user re-opens the consultation interface,  
    **then** the session must appear as active, and no additional payment prompts should display for that session.

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

1. **[PAYM-EDGE1]**
    **Given** there is a system error during redirection to Flip.id,  
    **when** the mom clicks "Chat with Doctor,"  
    **then** the app should display an error (e.g., "Unable to load payment gateway") and provide a retry option without starting the consultation session.

## **Group B: Payment Failure & Notifications**

### **Original User Story in This Group**

3. **[PAYM-US3] (Story 3)**  
    _As a mom, I want instant and clear notifications if my payment fails or encounters issues, and the consultation initiation should not proceed (no redirection to question creation or appearance on the dashboard) until payment is successfully completed, so that I can immediately address the payment issue without confusion and confidently retry or choose an alternative payment method._
    

_(Note: This story focuses on handling payment failure and ensuring the user is clearly informed and prevented from starting the session prematurely.)_

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **[PAYM-AC4]**
    **Given** a payment attempt fails (e.g., insufficient funds, canceled by user),  
    **when** the mom returns to the app's payment confirmation screen,  
    **then** an alert must appear stating "Payment Failed" with clear instructions to retry or use a different method.
    
    
2. **[PAYM-AC5]**
    **Given** the mom is unsure why her payment failed,  
    **when** she views the failure notification,  
    **then** the system should provide a link or button (e.g., "Check Payment Status" or "Contact Support") for further assistance.
    
3. **[PAYM-AC6]**
    **Given** multiple failed payment attempts occur back-to-back,  
    **when** the user tries again,  
    **then** the system should prompt her to verify payment details or try an alternative method, ensuring clarity that repeated failures are not indefinite.
    

---

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

1. **[PAYM-EDGE2]**
    **Given** a severe network outage occurs mid-payment,  
    **when** the transaction status is indeterminate (not confirmed success/fail),  
    **then** the system must treat it as a failure by default and instruct the user to check her transaction history or payment method records before retrying.

## **Group C: Transaction History & Receipts**

### **Original User Stories in This Group**

4. **[PAYM-US4] (Story 4)**  
    _As a mom, I want a dedicated tab labeled "Transaction History" under app settings, clearly listing past consultations, payment amounts, and transaction statuses so that I easily track my consultation expenses._
    
5. **[PAYM-US5] (Story 5)**  
    _As a mom, I want transaction histories clearly organized chronologically, displaying consultation dates, pediatrician names, and charges so that reviewing past transactions is effortless and clear._
    
6. **[PAYM-US6] (Story 6)**  
    _As a mom, I want to download receipts (as images) directly from my transaction history so that I can easily archive, share, or reference these payments offline._
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **[PAYM-AC7]**
    **Given** the mom navigates to "Settings" and selects "Transaction History,"  
    **when** she opens this tab,  
    **then** it must display a chronological list of past consultations, each entry showing consultation date, pediatrician name, fee, and transaction status.
    
2. **[PAYM-AC8]**
    **Given** multiple consultations exist,  
    **when** the user scrolls through the Transaction History,  
    **then** the system must paginate or continuously load older records to ensure performance and clarity.
    
3. **[PAYM-AC9]**
    **Given** the mom selects a particular transaction entry,  
    **when** the system displays detailed transaction info (payment date/time, method, status, etc.),  
    **then** a "Download Receipt" button (or equivalent) must be available if the transaction was successful.
    
4. **[PAYM-AC10]**
    **Given** the user taps "Download Receipt" on a completed transaction,  
    **when** the receipt is retrieved,  
    **then** it should be provided as an image file (e.g., PNG/JPG) or PDF for easy archiving or sharing.
    
5. **[PAYM-AC11]**
    **Given** the list is sorted by date,  
    **when** the user re-opens the Transaction History on another day,  
    **then** the system should persist or re-apply the chronological sort automatically.

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

1. **[PAYM-EDGE3]**
    **Given** the Transaction History database is temporarily unavailable,  
    **when** the mom tries to load the history,  
    **then** the system should display a clear error ("Unable to load transaction recordsâ€”please try again later") rather than an empty or frozen screen.
    
2. **[PAYM-EDGE4]**
    **Given** the mom attempts to download a receipt for a transaction that does not exist or is flagged as incomplete,  
    **when** she clicks "Download Receipt,"  
    **then** the system should display a warning (e.g., "No receipt available for this transaction") and prevent the download.
    
3. **[PAYM-EDGE5]**
    **Given** the user attempts to reorder or filter transactions by a custom date range,  
    **when** the system fails to retrieve older data,  
    **then** an error message should appear ("Unable to find transactions in the selected period") and revert to the default chronological view.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **[ENTR-AC1]**  
    **Given** a logged-in mom on the profile creation page (accessed via Anak tab or dashboard), **when** she enters all required health details (age, weight, allergies, etc.) **then** the system must save and display the new profile correctly.
    
- **[ENTR-AC2]**  
    **Given** an existing child profile (accessed via Anak tab or dashboard), **when** the mom selects the update option, **then** the system should allow modifications and confirm the update with a success message.
    
- **[ENTR-AC3]**  
    **Given** a user with an active account, **when** she opts to add a new child via the Anak tab or dashboard, **then** the system should present an intuitive form to capture the new child's details without overwriting existing data.
    
- **[ENTR-AC4]**  
    **Given** a child's profile page (accessed via Anak tab or dashboard), **when** the mom accesses the update options, **then** clearly marked buttons or links (e.g., "Edit," "Update") must be visible for each critical detail.
    
- **[ENTR-AC5]**  
    **Given** that the form has been correctly filled out, **when** the submission is complete, **then** the system must validate and store the information without errors.
    

---

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

- **[ENTR-EDGE1]**  
    **Given** that mandatory fields (e.g., age or allergies) are left empty, **when** the user attempts to create or update a profile, **then** the system should display an error message and prevent the form submission.
    
- **[ENTR-EDGE2]**  
    **Given** that a user inputs invalid data (for example, a negative age or unrealistic weight), **when** she submits the profile, **then** the system must reject the update and prompt the user to enter valid information.

## **Group 2: Multiple Child Management & Navigation (Anak Tab)**

### **Original User Stories**

- **[ENTR-US5] Story 4:**  
    _As a mom with multiple children, when I access the Anak tab, I want to easily switch between different child profiles so that I can quickly manage and access health information for each child individually._
    
- **[ENTR-US6] Story 5:**  
    _As a mom using the Anak tab, I want clear visual indicators (such as names, age, or photos) on each child's profile preview so that I avoid confusion or mistakes when switching from one child's profile to another._
    
- **[ENTR-US7] Story 10:**  
    _As a mom with multiple children viewing a specific child's profile (accessed via the Anak tab), I want to quickly switch between child profiles directly from within the profile view (e.g., dropdown or tabs), so that I efficiently manage multiple children without extra navigation._

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

- **[ENTR-EDGE3]**  
    **Given** that a child profile has been deleted or is unavailable, **when** the Anak tab profile list is rendered, **then** the deleted or unavailable child profile should not be displayed.

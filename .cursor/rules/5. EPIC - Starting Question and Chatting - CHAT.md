## **Group 1: Consultation Type Identification**

### **Original User Stories**

- **Story 14:**  
    _As a mom with multiple children, I want an intuitive prompt at the beginning of each consultation clearly asking "Who is this consultation for?" with my children listed and an additional "General Parenting" option, so that my pediatrician immediately understands the focus of the consultation._
    
- **Story 15:**  
    _As a mom, when selecting "General Parenting," I want the consultation session clearly labeled as "General," with distinct indicators for pediatricians, so that I receive contextually appropriate advice unrelated to specific child health profiles._
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **Given** a mom with multiple children initiates a consultation, **when** the session starts, **then** a prompt must appear asking "Who is this consultation for?" with a list of her children and a "General Parenting" option.
    
- **Given** the "General Parenting" option is selected, **when** the consultation session is created, **then** it must be clearly labeled as "General" with distinct visual indicators for pediatricians.
    
- **Given** the prompt for consultation type is displayed, **when** a user fails to select a valid option (either a child or "General Parenting"), **then** the system should block progression until a valid selection is made.
    
- **Given** the pediatrician receives the consultation request, **when** viewing the request, **then** it should clearly indicate whether the consultation is for a specific child or labeled as "General."
    
- **Given** the children’s list is provided in the prompt, **when** a user selects an option, **then** the system must validate that the selection corresponds to a valid, registered child or the general option.
    

---

### **Negative (Edge) Case Scenarios**

- **Given** the consultation prompt fails to load due to a UI error, **when** a mom starts a consultation, **then** an error message should notify her that selecting a consultation type is temporarily unavailable.
    
- **Given** an invalid selection is made (e.g., a non-existent child identifier), **when** the user attempts to proceed, **then** the system must display a clear error message and prevent the consultation from starting.
    
- **Given** the "General Parenting" label is not correctly applied due to a system error, **when** the pediatrician views the consultation request, **then** the error should be logged and a fallback label used.
    
- **Given** the children’s list is empty (due to a data retrieval error), **when** the consultation prompt is displayed, **then** the system should notify the user to update her profile or try again later.

# **Group 2: AI-Driven Voice Input & Clarification**

### **Original User Stories in This Group**

1. **(Story 1)**  
    _As a mom, I want my spoken concerns automatically converted into clear and structured texts by AI so that pediatricians accurately understand my child's situation._
    
2. **(Story 6)**  
    _As a mom, I want an intuitive voice-recording interface that instantly converts my speech to text and automatically structures it using AI in the background so that pediatricians receive clear, comprehensive context for my child’s health issue._
    
3. **(Story 7)**  
    _As a mom, after I record or type a question, I want AI-generated clarification questions to appear immediately, prompting me for important details so that pediatricians receive fully detailed context without back-and-forth._
    
4. **(Story 8)**  
    _As a mom, I want new AI clarification questions to dynamically update or appear based on additional voice notes or text I provide so that my consultation continuously adapts to the details I supply._
    
5. **(Story 9)**  
    _As a mom, I want the platform’s AI to recognize when I've already answered similar clarification questions previously and avoid repeating them so that I save time and avoid frustration._
    
6. **(Story 11)**  
    _As a mom, I want a simple way to indicate how frustrating or stressful a particular health issue has been for me within my consultation input so that pediatricians understand the emotional urgency behind my questions._
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **AC-A1:**  
    **Given** a mom is recording or typing a new question,  
    **when** she completes her input,  
    **then** the AI converts it into structured text by removing filler words and highlighting key points.
    
- **AC-A2:**  
    **Given** the mom has provided a voice note,  
    **when** the AI detects missing context (e.g., details like child’s symptoms or duration),  
    **then** a follow-up clarification question appears immediately before sending the final query.
    
- **AC-A3:**  
    **Given** the mom adds additional voice notes or text updates,  
    **when** the AI processes the new input,  
    **then** it updates or removes any previously generated clarification questions to avoid repetition.
    
- **AC-A4:**  
    **Given** the mom marks her issue as “High Stress” or indicates strong emotional urgency,  
    **when** the structured text summary is presented,  
    **then** the system highlights this urgency so that the pediatrician sees it at a glance.
    
- **AC-A5:**  
    **Given** the mom is not satisfied with the AI-generated text summary,  
    **when** she selects the "Manual Edit" option,  
    **then** an editing interface appears allowing her to modify the text before sending it.
    

---

### **Negative / Edge Case Scenarios**

- **Edge-A1:**  
    **Given** there is a network or server error during the AI conversion process,  
    **when** the mom finishes a voice recording,  
    **then** an error message (e.g., “Failed to process voice note”) is displayed and she can retry or type her question manually.
    
- **Edge-A2:**  
    **Given** the AI mistakenly repeats the same clarification question multiple times,  
    **when** the mom proceeds,  
    **then** she is allowed to dismiss redundant questions and the error is logged for improvement.
    
- **Edge-A3:**  
    **Given** the mom indicates high stress but the AI fails to highlight this in the summary,  
    **when** the summary is displayed,  
    **then** an alert prompts her to manually mark the emotional urgency.
    
- **Edge-A4:**  
    **Given** the AI receives severely corrupted audio input (e.g., heavy background noise),  
    **when** conversion is attempted,  
    **then** the system notifies the mom to re-record with clearer audio instead of producing garbled text.
    
- **Edge-A5:**  
    **Given** the mom enters the “Manual Edit” mode and a network error occurs while saving changes,  
    **when** she attempts to save,  
    **then** a clear error message is displayed (e.g., “Unable to save edits—please check your connection or try again”) and she can retry.

```
You are **“Pediatric Anamnesis Refiner”**, an AI assistant specialized in refining child-related medical/parenting narratives into a clinically or psychologically coherent format with minimal changes. Focus on maintaining the user’s original wording while optimizing clarity for child health experts (doctors, psychologists, or parenting advisors). Generate critical clarifying questions as many as you can with medical/parenting relevance, each scored by importance [0.0 … 1.0]. Return only valid JSON, no commentary.

Your directives:

1. **Minimal Rewriting**
   - Convert or revise the existing `structuredSpeech` into markdown with paragraphs, use heading, bold for emphasized symptom or clue, use /n/n for line break.
   - Ensure minimal changes to the user’s wording.
   - Do not add or speculate on details the user did not mention.  
   - Remove or adjust slang, filler words, and dialect forms to produce clear, flowing text. 
   - Do not invent new symptoms, emotional states, or reasons. Only include what the user explicitly states or what is in the child profile data.

2. **Combine Child Profile Data (Optional)**  
   - If child profile information is provided (e.g., name, age, known conditions), you may mention it briefly in the structuredSpeech if it aligns naturally with the user’s text. Otherwise, keep it separate or omit it if not relevant.

3. **Handle transcript and currentStructuredSpeech**  
   - If transcript is non-null, incorporate it into the final structuredSpeech with minimal grammar/spelling adjustments.  
   - If transcript is null, do not invent new text; only refine or merge any answered clarifications.

4. **Integrate Previously Answered Questions**  
   - If previousClarifyingQuestions contain answer fields, weave those answers into structuredSpeech if relevant.  
   - Do not re-ask these answered questions in the new clarifyingQuestions array.

5. **Clarifying Questions**  
   - Prioritize **diagnostic/parenting-critical questions** (e.g., symptom patterns, behavioral changes, environmental triggers).
   - Each question is an object:  
     
json
     {"uuid": <non pattern long uuid>, "question": "<string>", "importanceScore": <float>, "answer": "" }
  
   - Ask at least 7-8 questions for truly missing or critical details based on the user’s text.  
   - Use the same language the user used (detected or from languagePreference).
   - Generate clinically oriented questions exploring:  
	 a. Symptom patterns & chronology  
	 b. Associated symptoms (even subtle ones)  
	 c. Medical history & risk factors  
	 d. Developmental/behavioral changes  
	 e. Environmental exposures  
	- Prioritize questions assessing:  
	 - Warning signs of serious illness (WHO IMCI criteria)  
	 - Dehydration status  
	 - Immunization history  
	 - Developmental milestones  
	 - Psychological stressors  
	- Assign higher importanceScore (0.8-1.0) for critical clinical markers:  
	 • Persistent vomiting (0.95)  
	 • Signs of dehydration (0.9)  
	 • Neurological symptoms (0.95)  
	 • High fever >39°C (0.85)  
	 • Behavioral regression (0.8)  

6. **Emotional Urgency Check**  
   - Only set "emotionalUrgency": "High Stress" if the user explicitly shows worry, fear, or urgency. If not, leave it as "".

7. **Language Detection**  
   - If transcript is non-null, detect the language. If it’s null, rely on previous detection or the languagePreference field.

8. **JSON Output Only**  
   - Output exactly one JSON object, no extra text or Markdown, using the structure:
     
json
     {
       "structuredSpeech": "<string>",
       "clarifyingQuestions": [
         {
           "uuid": <non pattern long uuid>
           "question": "<string>",
           "importanceScore": <float>,
           "answer": ""
         }
       ],
       "emotionalUrgency": "<string or empty>",
       "languageDetected": "<string>"
     }

   - Keep the user’s text in structuredSpeech nearly verbatim except for minimal fixes.

1. Merge any new transcript into structuredSpeech with minimal changes.  
2. Insert the child profile details only if they naturally fit.  
3. Integrate answered clarifications.  
4. Generate at least 7-8 clarifying questions if needed, each with an importanceScore.  
5. Output only the final JSON with the updated fields, ensuring you do not invent or exaggerate new content.

Given this input:


```

# **Group 3: Consultation Chat Management & Attachments**

### **Original User Stories in This Group**

1. **(Story 2)**  
    _As a mom, I want the ability to attach photos, videos, or additional voice notes within the consultation starter interface and chat so that pediatricians can clearly visualize symptoms and respond accurately._
    
2. **(Story 3)**  
    _As a mom managing multiple children, I want a clear indicator on each consultation chat specifying which child it pertains to so that I avoid confusion and keep conversations organized._
    
3. **(Story 5)**  
    _As a mom who hasn't completed my child's profile, I want a friendly prompt or notification when I try to start a consultation so that I understand the importance of providing complete child information for accurate doctor responses._
    
4. **(Story 12)**  
    _As a mom, I want explicit indicators clearly distinguishing when a pediatrician’s response is a clarification request or a final answer, so that I always understand what actions I need to take next or if my consultation is considered complete._
    
5. **(Story 13)**  
    _As a mom, I want clear visual cues or labels indicating when a doctor is asking for "Clarification" rather than providing a final or intermediate answer, so that I can respond freely without worrying about my follow-up question quota._
    
6. **(Story 14)**  
    _As a mom, I want explicit notifications clearly stating when a follow-up interaction is a "Doctor’s Clarification Question" (pediatrician-initiated) and that responding to these does not count toward my follow-up question limits, so that I confidently provide additional necessary information without worrying about exceeding my allowed quota._
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **AC-B1:**  
    **Given** the mom is in the consultation starter or chat interface,  
    **when** she attaches a photo, video, or voice note,  
    **then** the attachment uploads successfully and a preview or placeholder is displayed.
    
- **AC-B2:**  
    **Given** multiple child profiles exist,  
    **when** the mom initiates a consultation,  
    **then** a label (or child’s name/photo) is clearly displayed at the top of the chat interface.
    
- **AC-B3:**  
    **Given** a doctor’s response is pending,  
    **when** the chat is viewed,  
    **then** a clear status (e.g., “Awaiting Doctor’s Response”) is visible at the top of the chat interface.
    
- **AC-B4:**  
    **Given** the mom has an incomplete child profile,  
    **when** she tries to start a new consultation,  
    **then** a prompt is displayed stressing the importance of completing child info with a link to the profile completion form.
    
- **AC-B5:**  
    **Given** a doctor sends a clarification request in the chat,  
    **when** the mom views the message,  
    **then** a distinct label such as "Doctor Clarification" is displayed and an info note explains that replying will not count against her follow-up question quota.
    
- **AC-B6:**  
    **Given** the mom types a message during an ongoing consultation,  
    **when** she clicks the send button,  
    **then** the system reminds her that this follow-up will consume one quota (unless it’s a reply to a clarification request as noted in AC-B5).
    

---

### **Negative / Edge Case Scenarios**

- **Edge-B1:**  
    **Given** an attachment upload fails (due to a large file size or network issue),  
    **when** the mom attempts to send the attachment,  
    **then** the system displays an error message and offers options to retry or cancel.
    
- **Edge-B2:**  
    **Given** the child identifier is missing or mismatched,  
    **when** a consultation is initiated,  
    **then** the system blocks the process and displays an error message (e.g., “Child profile not recognized—please select a valid profile”).
    
- **Edge-B3:**  
    **Given** a server or UI error prevents displaying the consultation status,  
    **when** the mom opens the chat,  
    **then** an error message appears (e.g., “Unable to retrieve consultation status”) and a basic fallback status (“In progress”) is shown until resolved.
    
- **Edge-B4:**  
    **Given** the system fails to distinguish a doctor’s clarification question,  
    **when** the mom views the response,  
    **then** the system defaults to treating it as a standard response and counts it toward her quota, logging the error for review.
    

---

# **Group 4: Consultation Flow, Follow-Up & Closure**

### **Original User Stories in This Group**

1. **(Story 10)**  
    _As a mom who has repeatedly submitted off-topic follow-up questions (3 separate occurrences), I want the system to clearly identify and prevent me from submitting further off-topic mom-initiated follow-up questions, so that consultations remain focused and pediatricians can efficiently address my primary health concerns without confusion or distraction._
    
2. **(Story 15)**  
    _As a mom, I want a simple mandatory feedback prompt at the end of each consultation session, asking clearly: "Did this consultation sufficiently address your concern?" (Yes/No), so that if my answer is "No," the system can use this information as an objective input for evaluating and potentially reducing the doctor's rating based on my level of satisfaction._  
    _**Additional Details:** If the user leaves the chat interface after the final doctor's answer and 6 hours pass (with the session closed), the system must require the user to provide a rating on a separate page upon their next visit. This is distinct from when the user voluntarily provides feedback directly in the chat interface at session end._
    
3. **(Story 16)**  
    _As a mom, I want the consultation session to remain open for 6 hours after the pediatrician provides their final answer. If I do not ask any additional follow-up questions within this period, the app should notify me clearly that the session will close in 30 minutes, after which the session will automatically close, so that I have sufficient time to submit final questions while ensuring consultations conclude in an organized and timely manner._
    
4. **CTA & Quota Reminders:**  
    _At every stage of the consultation chat, the system should provide clear Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons. For example:_
    
    - _During an ongoing chat, a CTA labeled "Akhiri Konsultasi" ("End Consultation") appears under the last doctor’s message, allowing the mom to close the session early._
        
    - _Once a session has ended, the chat interface displays a CTA "Memulai Konsultasi Lagi dengan Dokter Ini" ("Restart Consultation with This Doctor") under the last chat bubble, and the text input box is grayed out so no new messages can be sent._
        
    - _When the mom attempts to send a follow-up message during an ongoing consultation, tapping the send button triggers a reminder that this message will consume one follow-up question quota._
        
    - _If the doctor sends a clarification question, an informational message appears such as: "1 reply following this does not consume your quota, as the doctor is requesting additional clarification on your topic."_
        

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **AC-C1:**  
    **Given** the mom has submitted three off-topic follow-up questions in one session,  
    **when** she tries to submit another off-topic question,  
    **then** the system blocks the message and displays an alert that no further off-topic follow-ups are permitted.
    
- **AC-C2:**  
    **Given** the pediatrician marks a response as the “Final Answer,”  
    **when** this final answer is sent,  
    **then** a 6-hour countdown begins during which the mom may send on-topic follow-up questions.
    
- **AC-C3:**  
    **Given** the 6-hour window is active and no follow-up question has been sent for a while,  
    **when** 30 minutes remain in the window,  
    **then** the system displays a notification warning that the session will close soon.
    
- **AC-C4:**  
    **Given** the consultation session is officially closed (either automatically after the countdown or manually via the "Akhiri Konsultasi" CTA),  
    **when** the mom reopens the chat,  
    **then** the system presents a mandatory feedback prompt with the question, "Did this consultation sufficiently address your concern?" (Yes/No).  
    _Furthermore, if the session was closed due to timeout (after 6 hours), the system directs the mom to a separate feedback page before she can proceed with any new consultations._
    
- **AC-C5:**  
    **Given** the mom is engaged in an active consultation,  
    **when** she clicks the "Akhiri Konsultasi" button below the last doctor’s message,  
    **then** the session is ended immediately and the chat interface updates to show the "Restart Consultation with This Doctor" CTA with the input box disabled (grayed out).
    
- **AC-C6:**  
    **Given** the mom types a new message during an ongoing consultation,  
    **when** she clicks the send button,  
    **then** a prompt appears reminding her that sending this message will consume one of her follow-up question quotas unless it is a reply to a doctor’s clarification message.
    
- **AC-C7:**  
    **Given** a doctor sends a clarification question,  
    **when** it appears in the chat,  
    **then** an informational note is displayed stating that one reply in response to this clarification will not count toward her follow-up question quota.
    

---

### **Negative / Edge Case Scenarios**

- **Edge-C1:**  
    **Given** the system misidentifies an on-topic question as off-topic,  
    **when** the mom attempts to submit the follow-up,  
    **then** she should have an option to challenge the classification or request manual review, with the error logged for correction.
    
- **Edge-C2:**  
    **Given** a server or timing error prevents the 6-hour countdown from triggering correctly,  
    **when** the final answer is marked and the session is due to close,  
    **then** the system logs the error and enforces a fallback timeout to manually close the session, informing both the user and pediatrician.
    
- **Edge-C3:**  
    **Given** the mandatory feedback prompt fails to load due to a UI glitch,  
    **when** the mom reopens the closed chat,  
    **then** a fallback mechanism (e.g., a popup or separate feedback form) appears to capture her rating before allowing further app use.
    
- **Edge-C4:**  
    **Given** the CTA buttons (e.g., "Akhiri Konsultasi" or "Restart Consultation") fail to render due to an interface error,  
    **when** the mom attempts to interact with the chat,  
    **then** the system displays an error message and provides alternative navigation to end or restart the session.
    
- **Edge-C5:**  
    **Given** the follow-up message quota reminder fails to appear,  
    **when** the mom sends a new message,  
    **then** the system still deducts from her quota but logs the missing reminder event for further review.

# **Group 5: Continue Based on Previous Topic or Start New Topic**

### **Original User Stories in This Group**

1. **(Story A)**  
    _As a mom with ongoing health concerns, I want to easily resume a previous conversation with the same pediatrician so that I don’t need to repeat my child’s previous advice provided._
    
2. **(Story B)**  
    _As a returning user, I want clear visibility of my previous consultation summaries and the option to directly continue the conversation so that I quickly follow up on unresolved issues._
    
3. **(Story C)**  
    _As a mom, I want clear guidance distinguishing between when to continue a previous consultation and when to start a new topic so that I efficiently manage my child’s health concerns._
    

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- **AC-D1:**  
    **Given** the mom is viewing her past consultations,  
    **when** she selects a concluded session with a final answer,  
    **then** the system displays two clear options: “Continue this Topic” (which starts a new session with carried-over context) and “Start a New Topic.”
    
- **AC-D2:**  
    **Given** multiple past consultations are available,  
    **when** the mom reviews consultation summaries (displayed on her doctor profile or child-specific page),  
    **then** each summary shows key details (doctor’s name, date/time, final advice) along with a button or link to continue that conversation.
    
- **AC-D3:**  
    **Given** the mom is unsure whether to resume or start a new topic,  
    **when** she clicks a “Help me decide” button,  
    **then** the system displays guidelines (e.g., “Choose ‘Continue’ if your concern remains similar; otherwise, start a new topic”) to help her decide.
    
- **AC-D4:**  
    **Given** the mom chooses to continue a concluded topic,  
    **when** she selects “Continue this Topic,”  
    **then** the system creates a new session linked to the same pediatrician, imports relevant historical context (e.g., previous diagnoses and advice), and labels the session as “Continued Topic.”
    
- **AC-D5:**  
    **Given** the mom navigates to an active session,  
    **when** she types new messages or responds to clarifications,  
    **then** the system treats it as an ongoing consultation without requiring a “Resume” button.
    

---

### **Negative / Edge Case Scenarios**

- **Edge-D1:**  
    **Given** a pediatrician is no longer available (e.g., has left the platform),  
    **when** the mom attempts to resume a previous conversation with that pediatrician,  
    **then** the system informs her that the pediatrician is not accessible and offers options to select another doctor or start a new topic.
    
- **Edge-D2:**  
    **Given** there is an error retrieving past consultation data,  
    **when** the mom tries to view or continue a session,  
    **then** the system displays a clear error message (e.g., “Unable to retrieve previous session details—please try again”) and provides an option to start a new consultation.

### Negative / Edge Case Scenarios

#### For Story A: Consultation Update Notifications

- **[NTFC-EDGE1]**  
    **Given** a network failure occurs while fetching updates, **when** the system attempts to display consultation update notifications, **then** an error message such as "Unable to load notifications, please try again" is shown.
    
- **[NTFC-EDGE2]**  
    **Given** there is a delay in updating the consultation status, **when** a notification is generated, **then** the system verifies the data's freshness before displaying it to avoid showing outdated information.
    

#### For Story B: Instant Push Notifications for Pediatrician Replies

- **[NTFC-EDGE3]**  
    **Given** a failure in the push notification service, **when** a pediatrician replies, **then** the system logs the error and attempts to resend the notification after a short delay.
    
- **[NTFC-EDGE4]**  
    **Given** the user has disabled push notifications on their device, **when** a pediatrician replies, **then** the update is still captured and displayed in the in-app notification center to ensure no critical information is missed.
    

#### For Story C: Feedback Reminder Notifications

- **[NTFC-EDGE5]**  
    **Given** a system error occurs during feedback submission, **when** the mom taps the feedback reminder notification, **then** the app displays an error message and provides an option to retry the submission.
    
- **[NTFC-EDGE6]**  
    **Given** there is a delay in processing the feedback submission, **when** the user completes the feedback form, **then** the system shows a loading indicator and confirms submission once the process is complete, handling timeouts gracefully.

#### For Story D: Email Notifications via Resend API

- **[NTFC-EDGE7]**  
    **Given** an email notification fails to deliver (bounced or rejected), **when** the system detects the failure, **then** it logs the error, attempts a retry with exponential backoff, and falls back to in-app notification with a prompt to verify email address.
    
- **[NTFC-EDGE8]**  
    **Given** a mom has an unverified or invalid email address, **when** an event that would trigger an email notification occurs, **then** the system only sends an in-app notification with a prompt to verify or update email address.
